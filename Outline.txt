Scene 0:
Audience walks past various images of Olivia's online presence, such as notes to her, pictures of her, Facebook updates, Instagram photos, magazine reviews, etc. They become complicit in the act of building her identity and deciding who she is. 

Scene 1:
Logan talks to his therapist about the girl who lives upstairs, who has somehow enchanted him, because she's asked him to help her encrypt and erase some things online. (She wants him to make an online safe, so to speak, of her things.) He finds a note of hers that is strange but to him, makes sense and makes her seem like his soulmate. The note will be about the power of invisibility and the desire to live multiple lives. In the end, he listens to her singing through the vents, which feels creepy and makes him sad and makes it feel like she belongs to him.

Scene 2:
Upstairs, Evan and Olivia get ready for bed. Evan tries to cheer her up and remind her of the big changes that will happen in their life after the wedding and after the big performance that he is helping to organize for her. He reminds her of some marketing stuff she needs to do. She wants to consider the possibility of slowing down. She almost opens up to him about the fact that she keeps thinking about suicide, but instead, she puts on the happy, ditzy role that she is so good at. Midnight comes, she tries to write him a letter, but she can't, so she ends it at "Dear Evan." Then she shoots herself. 

Scene 3:
A strange memory/fantasy/Internet space on the beach at Port Townsend. Perhaps in the background there are frozen stills of shadows that change like clicking through photographs. Because he is only beginning to enter this Internet-driven place with her, they are only together in a small pool of light, and perhaps the stage set background is still Evan's apartment. They talk in a way that shows that they have been here before. Evan wants to stay in this vacation/heaven place forever. Olivia keeps reminding him that life has to go on. She is trying to make a sandcastle but instead she makes a grave. Evan hates it. It's stupid. There's a knock and Olivia reminds him he has to go, but he doesn't want to. She hands him a note. "Dear Evan -- what?"

Scene 4:
The lights come back up. Beth has brought food to Evan and is trying to comfort him. Perhaps he comes clean to her now that she did leave a suicide note, it just reads "Dear Evan." Beth lets slip about Olivia's interest or relationship with Logan so that Evan has that thread to follow. Audience gets a sense of Beth's interest in Evan, or that she cares about him more than a typical friend. She brings in some kind of contact from the outside world, perhaps a bouquet of flowers from a creepy fan, delivered to the wrong door? Or something else that is fan-based and a little bit creepy.

Scene 5:
Inspired by the creepy bouquet, Evan remembers to check on Olivia's media site and her e-mails/facebook, that kind of thing, after having been away from the world for a while. He finds a memorial built to her, and rather creepy notes from a guy named Timothy, perhaps acting in a way to make the audience suspect Logan of deeper involvement. Evan begins to engage with these messages from Timothy in a deeper way. He replies to him as Olivia. Perhaps we hear Olivia's voice behind him as he types. Which then leads us to jump right into:

Scene 6:
Olivia -- Why are you doing this? Don't you have better things to do? 

And this leads into another memory-conversation that reveals new aspects of their relationship -- namely, Evan's interest in her career. He wants her to have a very particular kind of image. He's not super controlling about it, but he sees her more as the pristine, Madonna type of woman -- the white rose, versus the red rose. He wants her to be the kind of woman who will marry him and have children with him, and he wants this image of her to be present in her work as well. However, because of the images he has just seen on the Internet, she is not that to him right now. She is dressed salaciously, and acts more petulantly/argumentatively. 

The scene/conversation ends on a little bit of a rockier ground, where the relationship is less than ideal, and we begin to question the two of them a little bit. It should perhaps also drive Evan to question who Olivia is, so that he is more curious about this Logan person. They end this scene with a fight. 

Scene 7:
Logan is in the middle of a tea party with his digi-friends, talking to them and keeping tabs on their lives. The scene has very festive music and adornment, but a very lonely heart. 

At some point in the conversation, Beth comes by knocking. She is trying to collect donations from the neighbors to help support Evan with funeral costs and rent fees. Logan answers the door very awkwardly and we see the way he interacts with people. They talk a bit about Olivia and Logan perhaps lets slip some intimate details about what he knows about her, that perhaps he shouldn't. Beth is intrigued, but not necessarily suspicious. 

When she leaves, Logan is lonely. He tries to re-start the tea party, but the spark of it is gone. He returns to the computer instead, encrypting things for Olivia. Instead, he realizes he has gotten mail from her, like she's alive. He writes back to her. Perhaps he tries to reassure her that he's kept her things safe.

Scene 8:
Evan and Beth scene. 
Evan is lying in a pool of light that has grown slightly bigger. Olivia sings in the background behind him -- the music is nostalgic and all-consuming. Shadows of her dance behind him. She  is just at his fingertips. He can almost touch her. The door knocks. It is Beth. Evan doesn't answer. She simply steps in on her own, because they've always had an open-door policy. The music and the shadows stop once she enters.

She feels like she is interrupting something, but she's not sure what. It feels like he is somewhere far away. But she's happy that she can present him with the card and the money from the neighbors. 

Beth asks him how he is, and he says he is good. He's been looking at some pictures, and finding ways to keep her memory alive. She thinks this is good and tries to get him to talk about some of the memories they both have of Olivia. Evan can recount a memory differently than what Beth knows it to be, or he can instead speak of dreams instead of memories, things for the future rather than the past, like a house by the ocean, a world touring performance wrapped up and a time to rest by the ocean. 

Beth leaves, feeling like she is a little bit in an uncertain space. After she is gone, Evan returns to the computer. He plays the same music again, and he enters the space of the Internet agian, but it's grown bigger and more populated.

Olivia returns. He's given her a bouquet of flowers (maybe somehow online) and they make up and recover from their fight. She is pristine again, exactly how he dreams of her to be. But right before they are about to consummate this moment, the roses all turn red, and the petals are scattered away. The ocean becomes red. When he touches her, she's become brittle and stiff, or empty as a husk, and he is driven to find or to recover what's inside. 

End of Act I



Act II

Scene 1 
We begin in the same digi-space that Evan ended on, except now the light has grown darker, and the place a little more malevolent. Shadows dance and sing past and around him. They are all her, and none of them is her. He finds the sandcastle/grave that she has made. He begins to dig inside it, maybe with a shovel. He unearths pieces of jewelry, scraps of letters, a wig and a mannequin's head, and finally unearths a locked box which is the thing that he was looking for, without knowing what he was looking for. However, he has no key with which to open it. Her shadows grow larger and faster and they fold in over him, until the light snaps back to normal, and we move on to another scene. 


Scene 2
Logan and Candie Scene. 

Logan contends with the fact that he has a new superpower of keeping people alive. This is what he's always wanted. It's like before, he could only play with paperdolls, hoping for a Pinocchio, but now the Blue Fairy has arrived. 

Candie is a little bit bored, but perhaps Logan's excitement gives her more insights into this Olivia person. She has more grounding on what's going on than he does. Perhaps she speaks for Olivia here in that everyone should just leave her alone. 

Logan is too excited to heed her. He wants to follow his Frankenstein-ian power. He wants to break open the box and recreate her, to break her trust and read the things that she tried to hide away. 



Scene 3

Evan has torn apart his apartment. It is no longer neatly packed away, but he has rummaged through all of Olivia's things, certain that she has hidden something of herself inside this mess. Olivia wanders in and out of the scene, like she is stalking his mind, and sometimes coccoons herself in the place where she died. 

Beth stops by. This is where she realizes she needs to save him, though she is not sure what he needs. Perhaps she thinks this is a time where they can pick up Olivia's things, decide what Olivia would have wanted to do with her things and her money, decide what things to keep and what to give away. 

Perhaps they come to rest on the jewelry box from Act II Scene I. This had belonged to Olivia's grandmother, and was a place where she kept all her treasured items. It has a lock and key. They break the lock, but there is nothing there. Evan needs there to be something there. In his weakness, he relies on Beth perhaps more than he should have? He doesn't kiss her, but he lets her embrace him, and asks her to stay the night. They sleep next to each other all night. 

Beth wakes up in the middle of the night with Evan's arm around her. It makes her feel like she is Olivia, and she wonders what Olivia was thinking the night she died. She lies down on the spot where Olivia died, as if that will help her understand what Olivia was thinking. She talks to Olivia. Later, she returns to bed with Evan, who is dreaming of Olivia. Perhaps, as a representation of his dream, Olivia comes over and kisses him on the forehead, and whispers for him to come join her, or expresses how he will always belong to her. (This appearance of her may be problematic, however)


Scene 4

Evan's apartment has been somewhat cleaned up, and he is preparing for returning to work. He and Beth have just eaten dinner on another night, perhaps the night before he returns to work. It is somewhat awkward between them as neither is certain how to proceed. While Beth is there, Evan recieves a message in his inbox from Olivia. He tries to hide this from Beth, but when he is cleaning or doing something else, she reads the note that is from Olivia, which is some conglomeration of things that Logan has put together in a mishmash of items from private letters. Later, after she leaves, Evan uses this letter to return to the Internet space, where Olivia joins him, and perhaps he asks her about what the letter means, and all she can talk about is fragmentation and broken pieces of herself. 

They can perhaps address the development of Evan's relationship with Beth. Is Olivia jealous? Or does she still try to encourage him to move on? Perhaps she first encourages him to move on, but then he is dissatisfied with this, and he wishes for her to be jealous. Which leads to her asking what he wants out of her, how he wants her to be. Perhaps she can play the role of the jealous injured girlfriend, and can enter the persona of another self. This confuses Evan, and leaves him dissatisfied. But then how does this correlate with her last appearance? He might question her now about the box and what is in it. But she has no answers, because she gave them all away (ie, to Logan) or because she's become confused in the multiple identities she occupies.

Evan realizes that he must search for her outside of their home and their shared space. 

  
Scene 5
After reading the letter from Olivia, Beth guesses that Logan is behind these communications. She goes to see him. 

Logan is meeting with Candie right before this. The Blue Fairy doesn't just exist now, but he is the Blue Fairy. Perhaps he tries to exert a control over Candie, but she doesn't let him, because she's not just Internet call girl, but she's also his therapist. She tries to emphasize how he has this need for control, but control is always an illusion. Beth's interruption of the session seems to prove her point.   

Beth is uncertain how to proceed and wants to make Logan, and herself, comfortable so that she can get him to open up. Logan wants to figure out what kind of person she is, and to figure out how to deal with having someone else in his space, though perhaps Olivia has been there before, but he had more of a connection with her because of her singing through the vents. They had a private relationship that way. They slowly are able to bring the conversation around to Olivia. 

Beth convinces Logan that Olivia just wanted to die and to be left alone. That he's hurting her by digging through her things. But Logan is still able to feel good about himself by taking on the role of Olivia's protector, like the sentinel of her afterlife. 


Scene 6
Evan keeps looking for emails from Olivia, but none come. The Internet space becomes barren. The music is tinny and hollow. Nothing comes alive. The Olivia who appears is more like a puppet than anything else. He tries to write her back to life, he tries to write in the rest of the letter, but he is a failed writer. Their wedding date is approaching, so he feels the emptiness more, maybe he finds the vows he wrote, or vows she scribbled down? (This feels repetitive of scenes in Act I). 

Evan wants communication with Olivia again. He makes the connection of Logan being the one behind this. He goes to find Logan? But what can he do? Where is the tension? 

Perhaps his fantasy of Olivia is able to speak the suspicions that he has himself. Olivia suggests that Logan is keeping her locked up, and that Logan is to blame for the suicide. Evan begins having dark plans of hunting down Logan.


Scene 7
Beth is optimistic about Evan's recovery and eager to see him. Has decided to make a bolder move in terms of their friendship/relationship. She knows she must give him time to heal and to move on, but she wants him to know that she is there for him, and not just as a friend. 

However, when she goes to see Evan, he is distracted and disturbed by his own thoughts and plans. Perhaps he doesn't want to kill or attack Logan, but he believes that some kind of confrontation is needed. He mostly ignores Beth, or uses her as a way to learn more about Logan. His focus is on Logan, not Beth. 

Beth doesn't know how to take this. She may think that a conversation with Logan would be a good way for Evan to move on. She would be wrong. Or maybe she just wants them to talk about something that is not related to Olivia. She wants him to make an effort at normalcy. She begins to see that perhaps there is no hope for the two of them. 


Scene 8
For some reason, Beth is compelled to talk to Logan about her problems. They've formed some kind of weird relationship, and he's a good listener. At least she doesn't have to worry about being judged, because he's such a weird one himself. So she goes to see him. She thinks they can be friends, and she's beginning to understand why Olivia liked him.

Maybe through the conversation, Logan decides that he can't really be Olivia's protector, or the owner of her identity. Her identity can't be owned. So he wouldn't necessarily want to give this to Evan, but perhaps he thinks it should be destroyed or burned. Beth is curious about what it is exactly that Olivia has given to Logan, so she both wants to see it, and she also wants to leave it alone. Kind of like how we are so curious about celebrity lives or grotesque-ness. 

But then! Evan bursts in! He's totally going to want to see this thing. He feels like it is his right to know this and to own this. He wants to have what she kept from him, because it feels like she has been deliberately cruel keeping things from him. 

Olivia's music in the background seems to get louder and more responsive to Evan's demands. Perhaps there is a tone of tension or anxiety? 

Somehow, Evan wrests the box of notes away from Logan. He opens the Most Secret Letter and opens it. The music ends and Olivia enters the stage as well as he begins to read (out loud or not out loud? I like not out loud.) We can see her doing something very banal, living a banal moment in her life, and perhaps catching eye contact, finally, with Evan who looks up from reading her letter. They share some kind of understanding in their look. And he must let her exist simply as she was/is. 


Is this ending too anticlimactic from what we discussed with suicide or not suicide or standing in the rain? Is it meaningful enough? What to do about an ending???
