Scene 0:
Audience walks past various images of Olivia's online presence, such as notes to her, pictures of her, Facebook updates, Instagram photos, magazine reviews, etc. They become complicit in the act of building her identity and deciding who she is. 

Scene 1:
Logan talks to his therapist about the girl who lives upstairs, who has somehow enchanted him, because she's asked him to help her encrypt and erase some things online. (She wants him to make an online safe, so to speak, of her things.) He finds a note of hers that is strange but to him, makes sense and makes her seem like his soulmate. The note will be about the power of invisibility and the desire to live multiple lives. In the end, he listens to her singing through the vents, which feels creepy and makes him sad and makes it feel like she belongs to him.

Scene 2:
Upstairs, Evan and Olivia get ready for bed. Evan tries to cheer her up and remind her of the big changes that will happen in their life after the wedding and after the big performance that he is helping to organize for her. He reminds her of some marketing stuff she needs to do. She wants to consider the possibility of slowing down. She almost opens up to him about the fact that she keeps thinking about suicide, but instead, she puts on the happy, ditzy role that she is so good at. Midnight comes, she tries to write him a letter, but she can't, so she ends it at "Dear Evan." Then she shoots herself. 

Scene 3:
A strange memory/fantasy/Internet space on the beach at Port Townsend. Perhaps in the background there are frozen stills of shadows that change like clicking through photographs. Because he is only beginning to enter this Internet-driven place with her, they are only together in a small pool of light, and perhaps the stage set background is still Evan's apartment. They talk in a way that shows that they have been here before. Evan wants to stay in this vacation/heaven place forever. Olivia keeps reminding him that life has to go on. She is trying to make a sandcastle but instead she makes a grave. Evan hates it. It's stupid. There's a knock and Olivia reminds him he has to go, but he doesn't want to. She hands him a note. "Dear Evan -- what?"

Scene 4:
The lights come back up. Beth has brought food to Evan and is trying to comfort him. Perhaps he comes clean to her now that she did leave a suicide note, it just reads "Dear Evan." Beth lets slip about Olivia's interest or relationship with Logan so that Evan has that thread to follow. Audience gets a sense of Beth's interest in Evan, or that she cares about him more than a typical friend. She brings in some kind of contact from the outside world, perhaps a bouquet of flowers from a creepy fan, delivered to the wrong door? Or something else that is fan-based and a little bit creepy.

Scene 5:
Inspired by the creepy bouquet, Evan remembers to check on Olivia's media site and her e-mails/facebook, that kind of thing, after having been away from the world for a while. He finds a memorial built to her, and rather creepy notes from a guy named Timothy, perhaps acting in a way to make the audience suspect Logan of deeper involvement. Evan begins to engage with these messages from Timothy in a deeper way. He replies to him as Olivia. Perhaps we hear Olivia's voice behind him as he types. Which then leads us to jump right into:

Scene 6:
Olivia -- Why are you doing this? Don't you have better things to do? 

And this leads into another memory-conversation that reveals new aspects of their relationship -- namely, Evan's interest in her career. He wants her to have a very particular kind of image. He's not super controlling about it, but he sees her more as the pristine, Madonna type of woman -- the white rose, versus the red rose. He wants her to be the kind of woman who will marry him and have children with him, and he wants this image of her to be present in her work as well. However, because of the images he has just seen on the Internet, she is not that to him right now. She is dressed salaciously, and acts more petulantly/argumentatively. 

The scene/conversation ends on a little bit of a rockier ground, where the relationship is less than ideal, and we begin to question the two of them a little bit. It should perhaps also drive Evan to question who Olivia is, so that he is more curious about this Logan person. They end this scene with a fight. 

Scene 7:
Logan is in the middle of a tea party with his digi-friends, talking to them and keeping tabs on their lives. The scene has very festive music and adornment, but a very lonely heart. 

At some point in the conversation, Beth comes by knocking. She is trying to collect donations from the neighbors to help support Evan with funeral costs and rent fees. Logan answers the door very awkwardly and we see the way he interacts with people. They talk a bit about Olivia and Logan perhaps lets slip some intimate details about what he knows about her, that perhaps he shouldn't. Beth is intrigued, but not necessarily suspicious. 

When she leaves, Logan is lonely. He tries to re-start the tea party, but the spark of it is gone. He returns to the computer instead, encrypting things for Olivia. Instead, he realizes he has gotten mail from her, like she's alive. He writes back to her. Perhaps he tries to reassure her that he's kept her things safe.

Scene 8:
Evan and Beth scene. 
Evan is lying in a pool of light that has grown slightly bigger. Olivia sings in the background behind him -- the music is nostalgic and all-consuming. Shadows of her dance behind him. She  is just at his fingertips. He can almost touch her. The door knocks. It is Beth. Evan doesn't answer. She simply steps in on her own, because they've always had an open-door policy. The music and the shadows stop once she enters.

She feels like she is interrupting something, but she's not sure what. It feels like he is somewhere far away. But she's happy that she can present him with the card and the money from the neighbors. 

Beth asks him how he is, and he says he is good. He's been looking at some pictures, and finding ways to keep her memory alive. She thinks this is good and tries to get him to talk about some of the memories they both have of Olivia. Evan can recount a memory differently than what Beth knows it to be, or he can instead speak of dreams instead of memories, things for the future rather than the past, like a house by the ocean, a world touring performance wrapped up and a time to rest by the ocean. 

Beth leaves, feeling like she is a little bit in an uncertain space. After she is gone, Evan returns to the computer. He plays the same music again, and he enters the space of the Internet agian, but it's grown bigger and more populated.

Olivia returns. He's given her a bouquet of flowers (maybe somehow online) and they make up and recover from their fight. She is pristine again, exactly how he dreams of her to be. But right before they are about to consummate this moment, the roses all turn red, and the petals are scattered away. The ocean becomes red. When he touches her, she's become brittle as stiff, or empty as a husk, and he is driven to find or to recover what's inside. 

End of Act I



Act II

Scene 1 
We begin in the same digi-space that Evan ended on, except now the light has grown darker, and the place a little more malevolent. Shadows dance and sing past and around him. They are all her, and none of them is her. He finds the sandcastle/grave that she has made. He begins to dig inside it, maybe with a shovel. He unearths pieces of jewelry, scraps of letters, a wig and a mannequin's head, and finally unearths a locked box which is the thing that he was looking for, without knowing what he was looking for. However, he has no key with which to open it. Her shadows grow larger and faster and they fold in over him, until the light snaps back to normal, and we move on to another scene. 

Scene 2
Logan and Candie Scene.
