Scene 0: 
Audience moves through the area outside the stage. There are flowers and pictures of Olivia and messages to Olivia posted along the walls so that it is like they have attended her memorial. They have a loose sense of who she is, similar to the knowledge we get of people we stalk online. They get a sense that she was a singer, that she was a bit of a local celebrity, that some people suspected her of a drug problem, that not everyone writing to her really knew her. 

Scene 1:
Evan returns home after the memorial. He has leftover food and flowers. The home he used to know is unbearably quiet and he doesn't know how to deal with the silence. He wants there to be noise, and he wants to not be alone. He wants her to know that she was loved. He spreads the flowers for her over the place where she died. He tells her about her own funeral, so that she doesn't have to miss it.

Beth comes by to check on him and to bring the rest of the stuff that he had forgotten. She tells him about an online memorial that had been created for her.

They talk about the surprise of the death and establish that though it was a suicide, they didn't understand why.

Beth makes a reference to Logan because Olivia had talked about him before to her. Evan is surprised. He's never heard of Logan. He begins to realize how intrusive Olivia's fans could be. He begins to see how they are infringing on his memory of her. Beth reminds him she doesn't belong to him, but in a way, to everyone, or to nothing? 

Beth leaves and Evan searches the online memorial site of the notes from people who didn't even know her. It begins to piss him off. He relaxes by looking instead at pictures of the two of them on the beach instead. Their album. Which reminds him of snippets of conversation they had on the beach, about having a place of their own. He wants to have their own space again. He begins to talk to her, and she talks back to him. We establish some of what Evan thinks 




Original Script:
Scene 0:
Audience walks past various images of Olivia's online presence and engages in making decisions about who she is. 

Scene 1:
Logan talks to his therapist about the girl who lives upstairs, who has somehow enchanted him, because she's asked him to help her encrypt and erase some things online. (She wants him to make an online safe, so to speak, of her things.) She finds a note of hers that is strange but to him, makes sense and makes her seem like his soulmate. The note will be about the power of invisibility and the desire to live multiple lives. In the end, he listens to her singing, which feels creepy and makes him sad and makes it feel like she belongs to him.

Scene 2:
Upstairs, Evan and Olivia get ready for bed. Evan tries to cheer her up and remind her of the big changes that will happen in their life after the wedding and after the big performance that he has orchestrated for her. He reminds her of some marketing stuff she needs to do. She wants to consider the possibility of slowing down. She almost opens up to him about the fact that she keeps thinking about suicide, but instead, she puts on the happy, ditzy role that she is so good at. Midnight comes, she tries to write him a letter, but she can't, so she ends it at "Dear Evan." Then she shoots herself. 

Scene 3:
A strange memory/fantasy/Internet space on the beach at Port Townsend. Perhaps in the background there are frozen stills of shadows that change like clicking through photographs. They talk in a way that shows that they have been here before. Evan wants to stay in this vacation/heaven place forever. Olivia keeps reminding him that life has to go on. She is trying to make a sandcastle but instead she makes a grave. Evan hates it. It's stupid. There's a knock and Olivia reminds him he has to go, but he doesn't want to. She hands him a note. "Dear Evan -- what?"

Scene 4:
The lights come back up. Beth has brought food to Evan and is trying to comfort him. She lets slip about Olivia's interest or relationship with Logan so that Evan has that thread to follow. Audience gets a sense of Beth's interest in Evan, or that she cares about him more than a typical friend. She brings in some kind of contact from the outside world, perhaps a bouquet of flowers from a creepy fan, delivered to the wrong door? Or something else that is fan-based and a little bit creepy.

Scene 5:
Inspired by the creepy bouquet, Evan remembers to check on her media site and her e-mails/facebook, that kind of thing, after having been away from the world for a while,
