Scene 1

(At one corner of the stage, lights up on a covered body lying on a table. The detective approaches it. Perhaps we don't even see him, but we hear him in conversation.)

DETECTIVE:
So, this is our girl, huh? 

OTHERGUY:
She's the one. Twenty-six years old. Asian American. Alleged suicide.  

DETECTIVE:
She was a pretty girl. 

OTHERGUY:
Once upon a time. You don't get any beauty sleep with a bullet in your brain. So what's the story detective? Why'd she go out like this?

DETECTIVE:
You know it's all confidential.

OTHERGUY:
You just let me know how I can help. 








Scene 1

(Logan sits at the center of the stage with his laptop. We hear the clicking of his keyboard, unusually loud. It sounds almost like rain. The light of the computer screen illuminates his face and upper body. At times, he looks up, squinches his face as he thinks, and then returns to work. Behind him, the sound of Olivia's voice begins to seep out from the vents. He takes a deep breath and listens. We see a wall full of photos of Olivia, and he gently strokes her face. However, before the music ends, a phone rings.)

LOGAN: 
Yes? ... I told you not to call after 9 p.m. ... Yes, I do work at night, but I don't work after 9 p.m. ... Yes, I know evening minutes begin at 9 p.m. Of course I know that. I use cell phones. ... Fine. Send it to my mail guy and he'll bring it over for me. ... Yes, I'll get it done by Monday. Okay. "Great talking to you, too." Good bye. 

(He crouches down by the vent again but the music is gone.)

LOGAN:
Are you done tonight already? 





SCENE 1

(Logan is standing in the rain, drenched, or simply standing in his apartment, drenched. He is very afraid. Perhaps Beth is with him, sitting by the computer, trying to stop the bad thing from happening, and trying to maintain an appropriate amount of Olivia's presence on the Internet. And the bad thing is Evan, pounding on the door.)

EVAN: Let me in! I know you're in there! Let me in! You never leave!

LOGAN: (Weeping and clinging Beth.) Don't let him come in. Don't let him touch me.

BETH: He won't hurt you. No one will hurt you. Look, you're okay. You're fine.

LOGAN: Rain outside, rain inside. Leaks on my ceiling and her blood's dripping down. I tried to collect it in my bucket. Can't we ever escape from here?!

BETH: I don't know what you're talking about. You're not making any sense.

LOGAN: I just wanted to help. I wanted to make things better. (Angry voice.) You can't do shit to make it better!

EVAN: Open up the door, you son of a bitch! I know what you did! I know all about you!

LOGAN: (Approaches nervous breakdown.) He's here. Don't you hear him?

BETH: You CAN make it better. You can change all of it. You have that gift! (She opens the laptop and tries to direct it to Olivia's profile.)

LOGAN: (Snatches the computer away.) Get away from that. That's not yours.

EVAN: You can't have her, you piece of shit! She's not yours!

LOGAN: (Takes his computer safely in hand, and pauses in front of his shrine to Olivia. There are many photos and articles of her. Perhaps Olivia can be on stage as well, wrapped behind curtains, still as a statue, a dead thing.) We made you so beautiful. But now you're not even real. (Squeezes his eyes shut.) I want to smell you like the way you smelled on the elevator. 

BETH: (Looks at him in surprise.) You were the guy in the elevator?

LOGAN: Every guy is the guy on the elevator. 

EVAN: LET ME IN!

LOGAN: (Closes his eyes in dread.) We're plunging down the first floor now. Time to get out. And go where? Where do we go?

BETH: (Stands up and holds his hand.) Back to the beginning.

LOGAN: But this is the end.

(Evan breaks the door down and barges inside. He holds a gun in his hand and looks at the two of them. He is out of breath and menacing and perhaps injured. Why not?)

BETH: Don't do it, Evan. Please don't do it.

EVAN: (Sneers.) I don't have a choice. (Holds up the gun and aims it at Logan.) You made this, didn't you? You pictured this in your twisted little mind. Exactly like this. 

LOGAN: (Whimpers and crouches down.)  

EVAN: (Sadly.) I was standing, just like this. The gun in my hand. Bullet poised to take everything away. Just like this.

BETH: It doesn't have to be this way. No one decided it would happen like this.

EVAN: All of it a gone. Just one little twitch of a muscle. A spasm. And then, all of it, gone. 

BETH: Evan. Look at me.

EVAN: So, you think you can build out of entropy? 

LOGAN: I don't want to die. I don't want to die.

EVAN: You know there's no death. There's only eternity. Show us your eternity.

BETH: Don't do it, Evan. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. 

(The gun goes off and the stage goes dark. The sound of the gun echoes and then distorts, soon turning into a bouncy, sine graph music, alternately looping us in and shrinking away from us, until the sound turns into something warm and amniotic and safe.)



SCENE 2

(On the beach at Port Townsend. Bright lights. Distorted bird calls.)
