Scene 1

(At one corner of the stage, lights up on a covered body lying on a table. The detective approaches it. Perhaps we don't even see him, but we hear him in conversation.)

DETECTIVE:
So, this is our girl, huh? 

OTHERGUY:
She's the one. Twenty-six years old. Asian American. Alleged suicide.  

DETECTIVE:
She was a pretty girl. 

OTHERGUY:
Once upon a time. You don't get any beauty sleep with a bullet in your brain.

DETECTIVE:
You did the autopsy?

OTHERGUY:
Yes, sir. 

DETECTIVE:
What do you think? Does a suicide correlate?

OTHERGUY:
No recent signs of struggle. Had some scars and burns on her body though. Mostly on the stomach. 

DETECTIVE:
Where no one else can see them.

OTHERGUY:
That's the idea. Could be self-inflicted. Could be somebody else. I'm not the detective here.

DETECTIVE:
Anything else unusual?

OTHERGUY:
Seems pretty straightforward. What have you got?

DETECTIVE:




Scene 1

(Logan sits at the center of the stage with his laptop. We hear the clicking of his keyboard, unusually loud. It sounds almost like rain. The light of the computer screen illuminates his face and upper body. At times, he looks up, squinches his face as he thinks, and then returns to work. Behind him, the sound of Olivia's voice begins to seep out from the vents. He takes a deep breath and listens. We see a wall full of photos of Olivia, and he gently strokes her face. However, before the music ends, a phone rings.)

LOGAN: 
Yes? ... I told you not to call after 9 p.m. ... Yes, I do work at night, but I don't work after 9 p.m. ... Yes, I know evening minutes begin at 9 p.m. Of course I know that. I use cell phones. ... Fine. Send it to my mail guy and he'll bring it over for me. ... Yes, I'll get it done by Monday. Okay. "Great talking to you, too." Good bye. 

(He crouches down by the vent again but the music is gone.)

LOGAN:
Where ... where did you go? Come back.
