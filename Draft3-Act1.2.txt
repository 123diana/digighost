Scene 2(EVAN and OLIVIA’s bedroom. Olivia undresses and gets ready for bed, rehearsing a song as she does so. She moves out of the bathroom and into the living room, putting her earrings away. As she rests her hand on the jewelry box, she seems to grow lost in thought. Then Evan enters. He's just returned from a late evening of work. Holy shit. I don't know what he does for a job anymore.) EVAN: You know what really gets me about cupcakes though? There's no good way of holding onto them. You always look like some continental prat. They're like, finger food, except finger cake, and they're just not very good.
OLIVIA: We don't have to have cupcakes. Relax. 

EVAN: I just want to make sure you never think another absurd thought about cupcakes ever again. (Kisses her.) Hello.

OLIVIA: Hi. How are you?

EVAN: Good. Looks like our ad campaign is about ready to roll out, and I'll have just enough time off to focus on the wedding and the concert.

OLIVIA: That's good.

EVAN: How was your day? Did you get the invitations out?

OLIVIA: Um. No, actually. I was running back and forth all day between my students and my rehearsals. So I just — ran out of time. I had breakfast with Beth today though. She said she'd be thrilled to make our cake. So. Your cupcake nightmares are over.

EVAN: That's awesome. We'll have awesome cake. 

OLIVIA: I'm sorry about the invitations.

EVAN: Oh, don't worry about it. I could drop them off tomorrow.

OLIVIA: You don't have to. I'll get them out.

EVAN: (Laughs at her sincerity.) It's okay. Don't worry about it. (Evan gets a drink and get ready for bed.) Nightcap?

OLIVIA: No thanks. 

(Evan returns with a drink in hand.)

EVAN: What's wrong? You seem kind of down. Did your rehearsal not go well? (Comes by and rubs her shoulders.) 

OLIVIA: No, it was fine. I'm making progress with the aria. 

EVAN: Oh good. What's wrong then? 

OLIVIA: Nothing. I'm just — Long day. 

EVAN: Oh. Tell me about it. (Kisses her along her neck.) 

OLIVIA: (Artfully disentangles herself.) I think I'm just going to go sleep. I'm tired. (She gets into bed.)

EVAN: Okay. (Shrugs it off and finishes his drink, puts some things away.) Hey. When we’re married, do you think we should get our initials carved into some kind of rubber stamp? (Moves away from her and does some other stuff.) We could get fabric paint and glassware paint. That seems like the easiest way to monogram all our dishtowels and wine glasses, right? We should have our own seal, you know. All the properly married people do. OLIVIA: (A small laugh.) That's an idea. 

EVAN: It's a great idea. 

OLIVIA: If you say so. 

EVAN: Maybe we should take a trip. Get away for a while. I'd like a break, too, after I get this project done.

OLIVIA: We're already taking a honeymoon.

EVAN: Just a small trip. A day trip. I feel like I almost need to catch up with you. (Beat.) We could go back to Port Townsend. Hang out on that little beach behind the inn again.OLIVIA: You hated Port Townsend.EVAN: And you found dusty flea markets and lopsided pottery unequivocally charming. I’ll never know why.OLIVIA: I liked the ocean. (Evan gets into bed, too. Olivia watches him get settled in.)

OLIVIA: Sometimes I feel like it doesn't matter where you go. You'll never completely be free.

EVAN: But it's still a vacation, right?

OLIVIA: Yeah. I guess so. (Beat.) One of my student is tone deaf. You know, the little six year old girl? I play her three ascending notes and she thinks they're descending. Today, we had the kids' recital with all the other classes, and she sang louder than anyone. Most of the kids are a little shy, but she loved it. She could barely stand still she was so excited.

EVAN: She was singing from her heart. Just like you.

OLIVIA: Do I? I think I sing from my stomach now.

EVAN: (Thinks about it.) Diaphragm. It's your diaphragm.

OLIVIA: No. I think it's my stomach. That's where all the tension is before I get on stage. And then, when I start singing, everything melts away starting from my stomach. And when I'm not singing, all I want to do is fill myself with food. I ate three hot dogs today. 

EVAN: Hot dogs? You? Ms. Gluten Free Rainy Day Vegetarian?  

OLIVIA: Don't judge me. They smelled so good. You wouldn't believe how good they smelled.

EVAN: Did you get toppings. You got toppings, right?

OLIVIA: Everything I could.

EVAN: Good. I'm happy for you. I think everyone should be free to enjoy their hot dogs. The only person holding you back was you. 

OLIVIA: Evan.

EVAN: What?

OLIVIA: Nothing. (Beat.) I love you.

EVAN: I love you, too. (Kisses her hand.) We're going to be so great together. Oh, that reminds me. The arts editor at City Scope agreed to cover the concert. Do you want to look at your schedule tomorrow and see when you can do an interview?

OLIVIA: Sure. I'll look at it tomorrow.

EVAN: You should post the new recording onto the web site too. Do you want me to do it?

OLIVIA: No. I'll do it. Tomorrow.

EVAN: Okay. Good night. Port Townsend. I'll look at my schedule and we'll take trip, okay?

OLIVIA: Okay. That sounds nice. 

(Evan kisses her.)

EVAN: Sweet dreams. 

OLIVIA: Good night. 
(Lights off until the middle of the night. Lights up on Olivia as she sits up in bed and ponders Evan’s sleeping form. She kisses his forehead and tucks the blanket over his shoulders. Then she gets up and walks around the room. She takes out a gun out of a drawer and a sheet of paper and a pen. She pauses a long time over the note she is writing, but then she doesn't write very much. Finally, she simply sets the paper down and curls up in a fetal position on the floor. It takes a while for her to press the trigger, but she does it, she puts that fucking bullet inside her brain. The sound of it jolts Evan awake.)End of Scene 2.
