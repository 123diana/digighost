Port Townsend, On the Beach

Against the cadence of ocean waves, which is an overwhelmingly large noise, but it never quite envelopes you, because as soon as a wave is about to touch you, it recedes back into the ocean, which is shapeless and enormous. The sound the ocean makes has no beginning or end, simply a back and forth, a conversation with no surprises except the occasional cry of a seagull or a hawk. 

There is sunlight, but no time of day. It is neither dawn, nor noon, nor dusk. There is simply a warm and comforting source of light.

They sit on the beach in a quiet and shared contemplation.

"Are we at the edge?" she asks.

"The edge of what?"

"This is where you either jump in or you walk away. What are you going to do?"

"Do I have to choose? Can't we just sit here? Let's just sit here. Enjoy the show."

"Maybe the sun won't go down on us."
