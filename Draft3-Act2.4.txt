Scene 4

(Beth goes to Logan's place the next day. She knocks determinedly. Logan answers the door in a towel. Not sure how to transition the beginning of this scene.)

BETH: Oh. Gosh. I'm so sorry for interrupting. I can come back later. 

LOGAN: Hello again.

BETH: Actually. Are you free right now?

LOGAN: Yes! Come in! Um. Something about your shoes. You can do whatever you want with your shoes. (Grabs something to cover up his bare chest.) Would you like to sit down? This chair is my most comfortable.

BETH: I need to ask you about something. 

LOGAN: Uh huh? Your name is Beth, right?

BETH: Yeah.

LOGAN: I'm Logan. It's nice to meet you. (He extends a hand to her.) 

BETH: (She shakes his hand tentatively.) Last time I met you ...   You said Olivia was your best friend...

LOGAN: (Nods.) But I lied. I'm not her best friend. Maybe Timothy isn't even her best friend. 

BETH: Who is Timothy? 

LOGAN: (Looks down. He can't really answer.)

BETH: I ... I saw some of the emails. Between Timothy and Olivia. They're still being sent. You're Timothy, aren't you?

LOGAN: I ... Sometimes?

BETH: What do you want from her? Why are you still trying to hurt her?

LOGAN: No! No, no, no! Timothy would never hurt Olivia. Timothy would never hurt anyone. ... He just wants to help. 

BETH: Was she? ... Did she? ...Was she sleeping with you? 
(***Is that a logical assumption for her to make?)

LOGAN: No. We just talked sometimes, on the elevator. I could hear it when she left, so I would meet her on the elevator. And she sat there once. In my best chair. 

BETH: What did you talk about? What did she tell you? Maybe you were her best friend. If she told you things she never told me. 

CANDIE: (From the computer.) Sometimes it's easier to talk to a stranger or a third-party. I'm guessing that's how it felt for her. 

BETH: Who...?

LOGAN: Oh, that's just my therapist. 

BETH: Oh. 

LOGAN: She's teaching me how to be in touch with myself. And how to self-love. 

BETH: Ooooh. 

CANDIE: It's an important life skill. 

BETH: I guess I should get out of your way...But I just wanted to ... I wanted to ask you to stop. Please stop writing to her. Please stop pretending.

LOGAN: But I'm not pretending anymore. I'm not. I know she died. I made her a memorial. On her web site.

BETH: That was you?

LOGAN: I know she died. But I don't know where she goes when she dies. Because she's still here. Look! She left me these. (He takes out the box from Olivia.) Really. It was her. 

BETH: (Fingers the papers inside the box.) 

LOGAN: So, she's gone, but she's still here. I have her in all of these pages. She asked me to put these online for her, to keep them safe. Don't you see? She gave me a way to save her.

CANDIE: You might be overthinking this one a bit. In my opinion. 

BETH: How are you going to save her?

LOGAN: I — I'm going to tell the truth — because I want her to know ME, not Timothy. And ... I'm going to ... I'm going to make her dreams come true. Everything she ever wished for, that she wrote down in her journals. I'm going to read them and I'm going to ...

CANDIE: I thought she asked you not to read them.

BETH: How is that going to save her?

LOGAN: People will know her. Everyone will know her. They'll hear her. And if they hear her, then ... then she won't ... float away.

CANDIE: It sounds to me like she wanted to float away. You put a gun to your head, that's a pretty loud statement. 

BETH: Who is this woman? Who are you?

LOGAN: She's just my therapist.

BETH: Who are you to speak about Olivia?

CANDIE: I'm just giving my professional insight.

BETH: You seem more like a professional con. And you didn't know Olivia. 

CANDIE: Did you? It seems like your girl didn't really want to be known. 

BETH: This is who you're getting "therapy" from?

CANDIE: I'm making a good point. You know I am. 

BETH: Maybe I would hear it better if you weren't pushing your boobs up at me. 

CANDIE: Are you saying no valid arguments can be made while wearing lingerie?

BETH: (Backs off and speaks to Logan.) I'm not here to cut in on your therapy time. I just wanted to ask you to stop. Please just let her rest in peace.

CANDIE: You know, I do agree with you there. Considering how she chose to exit the world, I think she deserves to be left in peace and undisturbed.

LOGAN: But look at these things she left me! She had all these things to say and no one heard her. I can make them hear her.

CANDIE: Is it not very obvious that she didn't want to be heard?  If she had a voice, she never used it.

BETH: She was a singer! 

CANDIE: I mean, for saying things. I think she let other people use her voice, and then regretted what she got. 

BETH: (To Logan.) Can you turn her off or something?

CANDIE: No. I don't work that way.

LOGAN: (Picks up a print-out picture of Olivia.) Look at how beautiful she was. But she was so sad. Her voice was so lonely. I didn't hear it before, but now I know that's what it was. (To Beth.) Why was she lonely? She wasn't alone.

BETH: I don't know.... What does she say? In her letters.

LOGAN: (Moves protectively over the box.) You can't read those. They're not for you.

BETH: I thought you said you wanted people to hear her. 

LOGAN: But not yet. I have to decide how to do it. And I have to ask her first.

BETH: But she's not here anymore. You're not really talking to her. 

LOGAN: (Beat.) I know. 

BETH: So...

LOGAN: But maybe?

BETH: No! No! What is wrong with you?

CANDIE: That's a little harsh.

BETH: She's dead! Why won't you just let her die?

LOGAN: Why don't you care about her?

BETH: She wanted to die. She did it to herself. She wanted to sleep forever and leave everything behind so why are you making him remember her? (Shocked at what she has said.)

CANDIE: I knew you'd come around.

BETH: (Frazzled.) I need — I need to go.

LOGAN: (Watches her go and then carefully puts his box away. Maybe dusts off the chair she was sitting in. Walks over to his computer.) Okay. How do we begin the self-love exercise?

CANDIE: (Sighs.) Okay, buddy. I think it's confession time. Here's the thing. I'm not technically a therapist. I mean, I kind of am. But I'm not a full therapist. I really specialize in self-love and relaxation/stress relief techniques.

LOGAN: Are you pretending, too?

CANDIE: Yeah. I guess so. We all are, really. Aren't we?

LOGAN: She didn't pretend. Not when she sang.

CANDIE: Well, look how far that got her. Sorry. I fell out of character. And I'm having trouble getting back in. 

LOGAN: That happens.

CANDIE: Yeah. So listen. I think ... maybe you should try talking to someone else. Somebody accredited. I don't know if I really want to mess around with this anymore.

LOGAN: You're dropping me?

CANDIE: Well, I mean, if you ever want to look at my boobs, or ... complete a guided self-fulfillment visualization exercise, you know how to make an appointment. My doors are always open to you. I just don't know if I can handle all the talking.

LOGAN: It was nice to meet you.

CANDIE: You too, buddy. So ... Your credit card will be charged in the next few business days and ... good luck, I guess.

LOGAN: Good luck to you, too. 

(Candie signs off. Logan stands there a moment longer, with the light of the computer casting a glow across his face, until lights off on stage.)
