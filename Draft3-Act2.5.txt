Scene 5

(Evan is returning to his apartment and finds a package outside of his door. He brings it inside and places it on a table, sorts through the rest of the mail, takes out his phone and makes a call.)

EVAN: Hey, Beth. It's Evan. I haven't seen you in a few days, and I know things were a little bit weird last time we hung out. So I just, um, wanted to check in, I guess I'll see you later maybe. 

(He hangs up and tosses the phone aside. He goes onto the computer and checks some emails. Nothing new has arrived. He sighs and goes over to open the package instead. Inside is Olivia's wedding dress.

Evan pulls out the dress and lays it on the bed, smoothing it and touching it. He closes his eyes and tries to pull her to him again, but he has become too disconnected from her. He begins to play her music again, and then he goes back to the closet, pulls out the jewelry box, which can be just the same as the first jewelry box shown in the beginning. He tries to get closer to her, but he cannot.

He goes back onto the computer. Perhaps there is a rushed susurration of voices that rise out from it as he goes onto her memorial page. The different range of voices can represent the confusion, anger, and loss experienced upon her death. And then, out of that mess, Evan finds a link to something new. A clearer voice emerges.)

LOGAN: (Back corner of stage.) Sunday, December 7. She was a young girl then, full of talent, full of hope. Her life was slowly opening up before her, but sometimes, she wasn't sure which route to take.

OLIVIA: (Stepping onto stage.) Rain today. Not a lot to do about it.
