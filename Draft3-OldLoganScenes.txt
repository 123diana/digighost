Alternative-Old Logan Scenes

Scene 1

(Lights on over LOGAN's bathroom. He has a fish tank that houses a brightly colored snake named ZORA. And a computer on a desk. The bathroom operates as his office. He is conferencing with someone over the computer. We can hear her, but we can't see her.)

LOGAN: 
So, it's not that there's something wrong with me. Or that I need help. It's just that ... I've changed. She's changed me. And I don't know what to do now.

CONSTANCE:
Yes. I see. And you said she's your neighbor.

LOGAN:
She lives right above me. I hear her footsteps. And I hear them talking sometimes. 

CONSTANCE:
And she's changed you because...of the elevator.

LOGAN:
Even before the elevator. I could hear her. She sings. From there. (He points to the vent behind him.) But then, I saw her. On the elevator. 

CONSTANCE:
Did you guys talk?

LOGAN:
...No.

CONSTANCE
How did you know it was her?

LOGAN:
She was checking her mail, and she was humming. So I looked at the names on the mailbox and I googled them. She's a singer. She has her own website. I'm friends with her on Facebook. Do you know Facebook? 

CONSTANCE
Of course. So, you're friends with her on Facebook. 

LOGAN:
Well, I'm not really friends with her. But Timothy and Timothy are. And I made Timothy and Timothy. So, in a way, I'm friends with her twice.

CONSTANCE:
What do you mean, you made Timothy and Timothy? ... Remember. You can tell me anything. That’s part of my job. I won’t tell anyone else. I won’t report you. And I certainly won’t judge you. 

LOGAN:
I collect profiles. I'm a profile collector. Creator. Collector.

CONSTANCE:
What do you mean?

LOGAN:
Sometimes I'll find a picture of someone online. Or an unusual name. And I'll take that person's picture and I'll make him a profile. And I'll give him a job, and hobbies, and friends, and their friends will write on their timelines, and take pictures with them, and sometimes they'll get married, or have kids, or start vegan recipe blogs. 

CONSTANCE:
You mean you steal identities.

LOGAN:
No, no. Not at all. The opposite of that, really. I — I gift identities.

CONSTANCE:
I see. Is it like...an imaginary friend? Are you creating tulpas? 

LOGAN:
No. Absolutely not. 

CONSTANCE:
Okay.

LOGAN:
You can't make tulpas based on real people. That would create an identity crisis. I just — I make dimensions. Alternatives. I give people the possibility of another life. Like, when my mail girl left for law school, I gifted her a profile, where she's a mail delivery scout, and she dates this guitarist, Mickey, who needs a kidney transplant, because he was born with only one. One kidney. I wonder how he's doing now.... Anyway, she doesn't live here anymore. She moved away, for law school. 

CONSTANCE:
You said she was your mail girl?

LOGAN:
She'd get my mail and drop it off for me, so I wouldn't have to go outside. I have a new mail guy now, but I found him on Craig's list. Do you know Craig's list? Yeah. It's not the best. I don't like this guy as much. I think he reads my magazines. The pages always feel...fingered. 

CONSTANCE:
How often do you typically get outside?

LOGAN:
I like being inside my home. I have a great home. It's a very self-sustaining system. I have everything I want inside my home. And if I don't have it, I can get it shipped. Usually for free, if I spend more than twenty-five dollars. 

CONSTANCE:
So what were you doing on the elevator? When...things changed? 

LOGAN:
It was the MiceDirect guy! Do you know MiceDirect? They ship mice, and they're usually very good. I've never had a problem with the packaging or the freezing. But I told this guy to bring the mice upstairs and I waited for him by the door and he never came and he left the mice downstairs, in the lobby. And I couldn't wait for Craig's list guy because I already messed up Zora's feeding schedule, and I forgot about Sunday, and she was starving, and I didn't want another dead snake. So I put on my shoes and I got them for her. 

CONSTANCE:
And what happened when you went outside?

LOGAN:
I saw her.

CONSTANCE:
Besides that.

LOGAN:
What do you mean?

CONSTANCE:
How did you feel? When you were outside? 

LOGAN: 
Fine, I guess. I tried to hurry, but, I was fine. 

CONSTANCE:
So you were outside in the elevator for like, ten minutes? And nothing happened. You were safe. What are some more small, achievable steps you could take toward your larger goal of leaving your house? 

LOGAN:
No. No. I don't want to leave my home. I like my home. I just — Something’s different now. I mean, she was there. Right in front of me. I could smell her!

CONSTANCE:
I see. Well. What is it about her that has so entrapped you? How has she...grabbed your goat, so to speak? 

LOGAN:
She has the most incredible voice. Like, every morning, at eight, she'll wake up, and she'll start singing. Scales, first. Just scales. Really softly. And then, like, half an hour later or something, she'll come back, and she'll just, burst into song. Like, her voice will explode into my bathroom.

CONSTANCE:
From those vents.

LOGAN:
Yeah. Sometimes, I feel like — it's like she decides what kind of day I will have, by the emotion encapsulated in her song. And it's never very clear or straightforward. It's not like that chart you use with the smiley faces — do you know that chart? "Today I feel sad," "Today I feel anxious," "Today I feel lonely" — and it's not like, "I am 83 percent bored and 17 percent excited." Or maybe it is like that, except without math. Because even when she sings a song that's supposed to be happy, she's got — she sounds sad. Or maybe music is just always sad. Like it taps into this sadness that words, when they're spoken and not sung, can't reach because they don't have long enough soundwaves. 

CONSTANCE:
Uh huh… How’s your relationship with your mother? 

LOGAN:
Fine. We talk on Sundays. It's just that, I never thought that the music was from her, you know? Like, from a person. It was more like, from God. Or like, the perfect algorithmically generated soul of every great composer and soprano who ever lived, combined in equal portions and programmed to release a new song every morning.

CONSTANCE:
It must be a very exciting bathroom you occupy.

LOGAN:
Oh, yeah. Sometimes she sings at night, too. Not every night, but some nights. If you wait for like, another half an hour, you might hear her. 

CONSTANCE:I’ve got another session, later, but I just want to ask, what do you hope to get from this woman? Do you want to see her again? Do you want to have sex with her?LOGAN:Of course not! She doesn’t have a vagina. (Makes a “vaginas are gross” face.) CONSTANCE:What do you want from her then?LOGAN:Nothing. I just want to see what she’s doing. She’s rehearsing for the Magic Fiddle now. And … and she’s getting married. CONSTANCE:Okay, so what do you get out of this? How does it make you feel? Watching her life blossom as yours, in effect, stagnates?LOGAN:What do you mean, stagnates?CANDIE:You willingly become a passive observer, rather than an agent. You spend all your time lurking behind your computer monitor. How does that affect your interpersonal relationships?LOGAN:(Beat.) I have lots of friends.CANDIE:When do you see them?LOGAN:When I go online.CANDIE:But that's not the same as being in an elevator, is it? Standing next to someone, breathing the same air, almost touching, trapped together.... How often do you masturbate?LOGAN:(Beat.) A normal amount. Are you … Are you taking off your shirt?CANDIE:Imagine, the inside of the elevator. It’s hot. Humid. You reach the fifteenth floor, but then you get stuck. The lights go off. Your neighbor, she’s so hot, she can’t bear it. She undoes the buttons of her shirt. There are beads of sweat appearing —LOGAN:I can see your boobs.CANDIE:And does that make you uncomfortable?LOGAN:(Defensively.) No.CANDIE:(Puts her shirt back on.) All right. We’re nearing the end of our session today.LOGAN:Where did you say you got your degree again?CANDIE:The nature of my study was very self-directed. But I hold several certifications from various accredited online institutions. I have many high profile clients. LOGAN: That’s why you’re so expensive. CANDIE:Mmhmm. So, a transaction will be made on your account within the next three days. Shall we go ahead and schedule for next week? Same time? I think we've got a lot to excavate here. LOGAN:Okay. I'll put it on my Google calendar.CONSTANCE:Great. I like to end my sessions with a visualization exercise. So, please close your eyes now, empty your mind, and take three cleansing breaths ... Good. What color is the inside of your mind?LOGAN:[Black.] CONSTANCE:A door appears inside the space of your mind. You open it. A cold and cleansing wind sweeps by you, blowing all the scattered bits of debris out of your mind, until only the essential essence remains. What do you see? LOGAN:[Brown.]CONSTANCE:Yes. Your brain is an expansive space. It can hold so much. And yet, and yet you look up and around you and you see the shell of your cerebrum. Transparent, first, but growing more and more solid, closing in on you. What is the shell that encloses your understanding? What keeps you from reaching your full potential? LOGAN:[Gray.] CONSTANCE:Wonderful. I think we've had a very successful session. I look forward to seeing you next week.LOGAN:I'll see you — (CONSTANCE signs off.) — next week.(The bathroom is empty. LOGAN looks around the emptiness. He crouches down by the vent and waits for the music. Soon, it comes, softly, then louder, and we move upstairs to...)End of Scene 1



Scene 5

(Logan sits inside his bathroom, waiting to begin his session. The floor of the bathroom is full of red rose petals and half-burned candles. Finally, his Skype phone rings.)CANDIE:Hello there. How are you tonight?LOGAN:(Ponders the screen but does not respond.)CANDIE:Can you hear me? Are we set up on sound? ... CAN. YOU. HEEEAR. MEEEEE?  (Fiddles with microphone.) Fucking Tad. I told him not to fuck around with cheap equipment. Next time governor of New Jersey wants to record everything ... (To someone else.) Tad! Hey, Tad! Stop whacking off and get your lazy ass over here!LOGAN:(Snaps out of his trance.) I’m here. I can hear you. CANDIE:Oh! Okay, then. Well, I, um — (To someone else.) Never mind! I – I won’t be requiring tech support anymore. You can ... go back to your business. (To Logan) So. Ahem. Last time we met, we dipped into some of the obstacles preventing you from optimizing your selfhood. How would you like to direct today's session? Where would you like to go?LOGAN:Nowhere. I like my home.CANDIE:I mean, what would you like to talk about?LOGAN:Oh. (Looks around and sweeps a hand across the petals.) Afterlife.CANDIE: What do you mean? Afterlife?LOGAN:I don't believe in heaven. And I definitely don't believe in hell. I’d like to believe in God. I don't know if I believe in ghosts, but I think, maybe. I think we all leave something behind, but I don't know what it is. It's like dark matter. Do you know dark matter?CANDIE:Yes. I've heard of it.LOGAN:It's like, the opposite of matter. It's not really there, and they didn't know about it for a long time, but then they said that if you listen carefully in space, you can hear it scream. You know how we're all made out of atoms? I think, maybe, when we die, we create the opposite of atoms. Like, negative space. And it works like a magnet, drawing the positive space we used to know as close as we can, until there's no more room to breathe.CANDIE:... Do you keep your windows open at home? Fresh air and sunshine are great medicine for emotional pain.LOGAN:No, I don't open my windows that much. It rains a lot here. Like, all the time. CANDIE:That can be depressing for some people. LOGAN:It can be dangerous for some people. I just...I don't like water. I don't like being outside. Because of the rain. And the space. CANDIE:Space?LOGAN:I don’t like space very much. I mean, I’m okay with it, in my home, in the bathroom, under the kitchen table, but I don’t like the space outside, or like, atmospheric space. I wish the world were flat. So the space could at least be in one direction. But, it’s, like, all around us, you know?CANDIE:Yes. There is space. All around us.LOGAN:Did you know that the diameter of the sun is 1.392 million kilometers? It’s like the biggest thing in our solar system by far, because you could fit one million Earths inside the sun, and still have room for like, Jupiter and a swimming pool. But the sun isn’t even the biggest thing in outer space. There’s another star, it’s called Betelgeuse, and it’s 700 times bigger than the sun. I think, in outer space, the sun is like, just a marble. Space is just ... so big. Like, if you floated away, where would you go? CANDIE:You pose an intriguing question.LOGAN:I don’t want to float away. I don’t want anyone to float away. CANDIE:I think that’s admirable of you.LOGAN:You know how sometimes they’ll say, “a web of stars?” Do you know that phrase? ... The thing is, actually, they aren’t webs. The stars are just scattered there. A “scattering of stars.” That’s a better way to say it. So, once you go too far into space, it’s just ... space, with an infinite amount of stars — big ones, and small ones, and, actually, they aren’t even in the same plane, sometimes. Some stars are much older than other stars. And they’re much farther away from each other than people think. So you’d just float away, into all these stars.... It must be so quiet there. But everyone is screaming. All the dark matter is screaming. CANDIE:Let’s bring this back a little bit. Last week, we talked about your neighbor. Where are you with that? LOGAN:She doesn't sing anymore.CANDIE:No?LOGAN:No. She, um, she went away. She got this fellowship to sing in Bulgaria. So she packed up and moved away. But the guy, he's still here. They’re just — they’re not getting married anymore. She’s going to be famous, though. The director of the symphony — his name is Claude? He's...he's really good.CANDIE:It sounds like you're keeping up with her Facebook feed and all that. LOGAN: Timothy and Timothy are. Timothy, um, Timothy sent her some letters.CANDIE:Did he? Well, that’s good progress.LOGAN:Timothy is a composer. He specializes in baroque and rock and roll.  Rock n' baroque. That's what he calls it. Cuz he's also broke? Do you get it? I think he could do very cool collaborations with her voice. It would be good for his career. CANDIE:That sounds wonderful. I’m happy for you.LOGAN:She’s not going to write back.CANDIE:Perhaps not ... but this is a good first step. You're taking the initiative to reach out to someone. And isn't the first step the important one of all? 
LOGAN:It doesn’t matter. When no one’s there on the other end.CANDIE:Sometimes people are busy, and sometimes mail gets lost. But you’re still sending your voice out there, towards another soul, rather than a void.LOGAN:I wish stars were like connect-the-dot. And you could connect them together.  CANDIE:So ... Timothy. Does he look at her Facebook pictures a lot?LOGAN:Sometimes...She doesn't look the way she did on the elevator. CANDIE:How did she look on the elevator? To Timothy?LOGAN:Timothy wasn’t on the elevator. How would Timothy get on an elevator? (Chuckles at her.)CANDIE:I’m sorry. I meant, how did she look to you?LOGAN:Fine. She was wearing a ... skirt, and a white shirt. She had a lot of hair, and ... so much skin. CANDIE:Was it a sheer kind of shirt? Could you see through it? Did it dip low, over her breasts?LOGAN:Stop it. I know what you’re trying to do. That’s not what I want.CANDIE:What do you want, then?LOGAN:(Beat.) Can you take off your shirt again?CANDIE:I’m so glad you asked. LOGAN:You have nice boobs. CANDIE:Thank you. LOGAN:(Takes out his boner. Hesitates for one shy moment. Then starts pounding it.) CANDIE:Slow down a little. Enjoy it. Shhh. Picture my hand on your cock.LOGAN:(Makes his weird masturbation sound.)CANDIE:Wait. Stop. (Logan stops and looks up.)CANDIE:Let’s begin this with a visualization exercise instead. Close your eyes, and take three deep breaths with me. We have to take them at the same time. It’s very important.(Some breathing synchronization occurs. Finally, they are able to take three breaths together.)

CANDIE:
Nope. Nope! Slow down! ... Okay. One, two — Nope. All right. Start over. One. Two. Three.CANDIE:Good. Good. Now. Picture us sitting inside a field. A damp wind comes and blows away all of our inhibitions, all of our uncleanliness, all of our shame, making us ready, for one another.  LOGAN:(Tosses his hair back to make himself spiffy.)CANDIE:You come to me. You grab me by my butt cheeks. You pull me close to you... When you’re ready, you feel yourself grow hard. You are harder than you have ever been, bigger than you have ever been. You are throbbing. You want to plunge yourself inside of me. You do it. You plunge.... Now. What color is the inside of my cunt? (Lights out.)End of Scene 5SCENE 8

LOGAN:Have you ever been to a midnight tea party?CANDIE:I don’t drink tea. I drink coffee.LOGAN:There’s no tea at the tea party. No one brings tea. Some of the vampires will bring blood, but they don’t really drink it or anything. They’re not really vampires.CANDIE:Good to know. LOGAN:Last time, at the tea party, Marie Antoinette was there, Joan of Arc was there, Benjamin Franklin was there — He was totally boring. He didn’t know anything about lightning — and three Elvis Presley’s were there. Do you like Elvis Presley?CANDIE:No. He stinks of patriarchal machismo, and he's afraid of women.LOGAN:Oh. Marie Antoinette is a vampire. She’s delightful. Do you like Marie Antoinette?CANDIE:I’m not informed enough to have an opinion.LOGAN:Cool. So do you want to go with me?CANDIE:Excuse me?LOGAN:Do you want to go with me? To a midnight tea party?  CANDIE:Nnnno. I think you misunderstand the boundaries of our relationship.LOGAN:Oh.CANDIE:I’m sorry. I used to have a handbook. I’m in the midst of updating it, but I could e-mail you a copy. I won't see your e-mail address. It'll be hidden.  LOGAN:No. That’s okay. It’s not a big deal. (Beat.) Let’s do "visualization" again.CANDIE:Pause your ponies. I’d like to talk first. You seem ... happier. Your mood’s improved. Would you like to detail some of the progress or achievements you’ve made that are contributing to your rising spirits? LOGAN:(Giggles?) I figured it out. The mystery.CANDIE:What mystery?LOGAN:THEE mystery. Of immortality!CANDIE:Uh ... vampires?LOGAN:No! Vampires aren’t real! We just talked about that. CANDIE:Okay. So, what?LOGAN:I don’t really know how I did it. But, usually, I have to juggle so many profiles, so many people. And I can only hold two or three of them in my hand at a time. When I toss them into the air, they can go anywhere. They get lost. But now, this time, with her ... she spoke to me. I brought her back somehow. Or maybe ... maybe I didn’t do it at all. Maybe it wasn’t me. I mean, who am I to think that I could — Maybe it was her. Because she ... she ascended somehow, she resurrected —CANDIE:
Okay. Hold up there. I don’t do any of that weird religion stuff. That’s stated on my web site.LOGAN:No. No. It’s not weird. It’s beautiful. I just wish I could understand it. CANDIE:We have twenty minutes left in our session today. Perhaps we should end with a lengthier visualization exercise?LOGAN:I don’t even really need to understand it, though. I’m just glad to know that it’s there. That she’s there. She’s all around us ...Like the stratosphere. She’s ... eternal.CANDIE:Listen. If you need to talk to a priest, or a rabbi, or a monk, or a shaman, that is fine, but I am none of those things. I am just a New Age Techno-Therapist, and, although I'm very good at my job, I just —LOGAN:You’re just wonderful. I really like you.CANDIE:Oh boy. LOGAN:I really like talking to you and doing visualization with you.CANDIE:Should have seen this one coming.LOGAN:Hey! Hey. What’s your name?CANDIE:We’ve gotten a little off-course, so let’s end today’s session a little bit early. You’ll only be charged for half a session, and I’ll send you a copy of my handbook. LOGAN:Okay. But tell me what your —CANDIE:Please read it. And then you can decide if you’d like to schedule another session! (Signs off.)LOGAN:(Sits quietly, a little bit abandoned.) My name’s Logan. It’s nice to ... meet you.
