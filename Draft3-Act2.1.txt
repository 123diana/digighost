Act II

Scene 1

(Evan seems to have been awake for a while but we're not sure what he's been doing. He walks over to the bed where Beth is sleeping and sits down. He stares at her perhaps a little more intensely than what is considered acceptable. She begins to stir and wake up.)

BETH: Hmmm. (Blinks some and looks around.) Hey. What time is it?  

EVAN: It's nine-thirty. We don't get enough sun through these windows.

BETH: Have you been up for a while?

EVAN: No. Not long.

BETH: Oh good. Did you sleep okay? (Begins sitting up.) Wow. I slept really well. I don't normally sleep well when I'm not in my own bed. 

EVAN: Hmm.

BETH: That was nice. I think I needed that. I'm normally not sleeping well in general right now.

EVAN: Yeah. Me too. 

BETH: Umm. Do you want some breakfast? I can make us a bite to eat. 

EVAN: No, let me. I'll make breakfast. How do you like your eggs? 

BETH: However. Scrambled, I guess.

EVAN: Scrambled eggs. Coming right up. Do you want tea? Coffee? Juice? I think I have orange juice. (Finds the carton of orange juice on the counter/table.) But...it's expired. Someone sent me a box of oranges, though. I can squeeze you some orange juice.

BETH: Evan. Wait.

EVAN: (Turns around for a moment and waits.) For what?

BETH: Nothing. You just seem really nervous. You don't have to be nervous. 

EVAN: I'm not nervous. I'm just ... invigorated. 

BETH: I'm here for you, Evan. Whatever you need.

EVAN: Ummm. (Distracted when he notices the wood shards of the jewelry box.) That's nice. (He shoves the wood pieces out of sight with his foot.) So. Tea? Coffee? Juice? 

BETH: I'll come help. Just let me go home and freshen up a bit. 

EVAN: (Distracted again as he catches sight of a bigger jewelry box sitting on top of the dresser.) Okay. 

(Beth exits and Evan walks over to the jewelry box. He looks at it for a moment, picks it up, sets it down. ***Or maybe he packs the jewelry box away right now, and as he is shoving it in the back of the closet or something, Beth enters again.)

BETH: Didn't you tear that thing up last night?

EVAN: What?

BETH: Did you hear the rain coming in last night?

EVAN: Oh. No. Not really.

BETH: Yeah, neither did I. Looks pretty wet out though.

EVAN: Yeah. Gets pretty rainy here, doesn't it? 

BETH: Should I get some coffee going?

EVAN: I'll make the eggs. 

(They move around together in the kitchen and bump into each other.) 

EVAN: I'm sorry. Excuse me.

BETH: Evan, it's okay. Listen. Nothing happened last night. And nothing's changed. I just want to be here for you. So, relax, okay? You're not going to hurt me. And I won't stop being your friend. 

EVAN: Maybe something's changed. Maybe something's different. 

BETH: (Not sure what to make of this.) Oh. Like what?

EVAN: (Has to walk away or pace or something to think about this.) You reach a point, you know? You get to the top of a mountain and you realize there's nothing there. Just clouds and fog. So you have to go back down the mountain. 

BETH: (Puzzled, then smiling.) Are you so poetic every morning?

EVAN: Not poetic. Just pathetic.

BETH: Nonsense. I think you're holding up really well. 

EVAN: I want to. I want to put this behind me now.

BETH: Someday you will. 

EVAN: I can't keep dwelling on Olivia. Going crazy over her. That's the pathetic part. When she didn't even care about me. I need to let her go. 

BETH: It's hard to let things go. When you don't have the answers.

EVAN: Yeah. I need answers. (Brushes a hand over his computer?)

BETH: I can't give you any answers. But I've got some other ideas for you. The Chiefs are playing the Bears tonight. Do you want to go to a bar and watch?

EVAN: Really. Yeah. You know? That sounds fun. I think I can vaguely remember what the world looks like outside this apartment.

BETH: Good news. It's all still there.

>>>EVAN: Can we go to that bar with the chess boards?

BETH: Yeah! That sounds fun! 

EVAN: This time Olivia won't be sighing in the corner trying to distract â€”

(He stops, distracted by his memory of her. Beth smiles sadly and reaches for his hand.)

BETH: You're not alone. That's all I want you to know.

(Evan smiles back at her, too, and flips his hands around so that they are holding hands. Lights fade out.)
