Scene 3

(Evan sits in his apartment, working intensely on his computer. Beth comes in carrying some shopping bags and a movie.)

EVAN: (Looks up and closes his laptop.) Hey. How's it going?

BETH: Hi. Um, I knocked, but ... Well, you knew I was coming by.

EVAN: Oh, I must have not heard you.

BETH: What are you working on?

EVAN: Nothing. Just some work I brought home. I figured since I won't be needing all that vacation time, I might as well get on a new account. 

BETH: It's only your first week back. You should take it easy.

>>>EVAN: (Picks up the movie she brought.) With "You're in the Superbowl, Charlie Brown?"

>>>BETH: (Shrugs.) It's a classic. But in case you objected, I did also bring: (She makes a face) "Plan 9 from Outer Space."

EVAN: (Laughs.) All right. Now we're getting somewhere. That was pretty crafty of you, Harrington. Pitting Charlie Brown against "the worst movie ever made." Unluckily for you, I happen to know two people in this room who can't resist a horrible movie. Give me that. (Reaches for the DVD.)

BETH: No. Let's do Charlie Brown first. Charlie Brown!

(They do some flirtation, almost-wrestling, and then both realize that they are in an uncomfortable position, and try to disengage.)

EVAN: Okay. I could live with Charlie Brown.

BETH: I can watch it myself, too. I usually watch Charlie Brown by myself. It's, um, hard to find a willing audience.

EVAN: I can be your willing audience. 

BETH: Heh. Thanks. Umm. Hey. I was thinking — I have to get up kind of early tomorrow — so, I might just go back and sleep at my place later.

EVAN: You can wake me up early. That's fine.

BETH: Yeah. But I should really — I mean, I need to catch up on my sleep a bit.

EVAN: You sleep better over here anyway. What's up? Why are you acting funnny?

BETH: (High-pitched.) I'm not acting funny. Everything's fine. Nothing's up. The sky's up. Maybe. 

EVAN: Come on, Beth. It's me. 

BETH: That's the problem. (Beat.) I think you're doing really well, Evan. And I'm really happy for you. I don't think you need me here at night anymore.

EVAN: I don't need you here, Beth. I like you here.

BETH: That's nice. But it's also really confusing. 

EVAN: What do you mean?

BETH: I — I'm a girl. I have ovaries. Sometimes my ovaries want things that I know they shouldn't want, but they don't listen to me, because they're ovaries. 

EVAN: I'm sorry. I didn't know. I'm so sorry, Beth. 

BETH: It's not your fault. It's just the ovaries. I don't blame you at all. And I don't want or expect anything from you. Like, my God, how could I? So, I just — sometimes I need to go back to my own place. I need to feel like myself. 

EVAN: I had no idea, Beth. (Pulls her into a friendly hug, in which we can see Beth looking a little confused and uncertain.) I'll make this up to you.

BETH: You really don't have to. (She pulls apart from him.)

EVAN: If you give me some time...

BETH: To do what?

EVAN: I just need some time. 

(He gazes at her a little too intensely. Then he leans in as if to kiss her. Startled, Beth jumps back a bit. Evan, who can't quite go through with a full-on kiss, compromises and kisses her forehead, leaving Beth devastated.)

EVAN: Let's go watch some Charlie Brown. 

(They move to the couch and sit down. Happy Charlie Brown music begins to play. As the television casts its glow over them, Evan reaches awkwardly and puts his arm around Beth. Beth looks at his hand uncomfortably, but she doesn't move away. They both keep their eyes glued to the television screen, Evan willfully oblivious, and Beth beginning to cry. Lights out to mark the passage of time. Lights back on.)
