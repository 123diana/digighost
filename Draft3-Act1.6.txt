Act 1 Scene 6

(Beth and Evan are in Evan's apartment having dinner. Beth heats up the food and brings the last dish over to the table.)

BETH: There. This is just like what my mom would do on Fridays. Throw out all the bad stuff and turn the still decent stuff into leftover soup.

EVAN: (Distractedly.) This looks delicious, Beth. Thank you. 

BETH: Hopefully it's not as bad as it sounds. Eat up.

(Neither of them eat and there is a pause, until Evan remembers to pick up his fork.)

EVAN: So how was your day?

BETH: It was good. I finished doing some errands, and I got to make the scones today. So, they're starting to trust me more at the bakery. Pretty soon I'll get to start making cakes.... (She trails off as she notices that Evan is not listening, but staring off into space.) I have a surprise for you. 

EVAN: Hmmm?

BETH: (Takes an  envelope and a card out of her purse.) This is for you.

(Evan takes the envelope without really thinking about it.)

BETH: It's from me and everyone in the building. To let you know that we care. 

EVAN: (Looking at the check she wrote.) Beth. This is a lot of money.

BETH: It's to help with the rent, and the service. I mean, I know you've got a great job, but you just put down so much money for the wedding and the concert and now ... I know Olivia was trying to budget and money was still kind of tight. 

EVAN: How did you get people to open the purse strings?

BETH: Everyone wanted to help.

EVAN: (Clearly not buying it.) I think you're the only person I know in the world who would decide to do something like this and have the ability to actually do it. Thank you, Beth. This was — This was really nice of you. 

BETH: (Shakes her head.) It wasn't just me. It was everyone. We're all here for you. And that guy downstairs? I mean, I know Olivia was kind of friends with him. But he really seems to care about her, and he was really generous.

EVAN: What guy downstairs?

BETH: Oh, you know. That guy. The one who, like, never leaves his house? He gets all his groceries delivered and all those packages that come in downstairs are always for him. Olivia knew him somehow, and I thought he was a little strange — I mean, he IS a little strange — but Olivia said he was nice. Didn't she ever mention him? 

EVAN: No. What was his name?

BETH: Logan. I think Blake is his last name? 

EVAN: (Thinking to himself.) No. That's not right.

TIMOTHY-TIMONE/LOGAN/NOTE FROM BEFORE: I am so beyond excited to meet you and I 

BETH: I think that was one of the most beautiful things about Olivia. She never judged people, you know? She was always so willing to talk to you and to listen. It didn't matter who you were.

EVAN: Everyone was the same and no one was worth a thing.

BETH: What?

EVAN: Nothing. I'm just...thinking out loud.

BETH: Are you okay, Evan?

EVAN: Yeah. I'm just ... When love becomes a memory, the memory becomes a treasure. Right?

BETH: (Relieved.) I think of that one, too. It reminds me of heaven, and storing our treasure in heaven. I have to believe that she's up there now, you know? That her pain is gone and she's at peace. I haven't been to church in years, but I went to church the weekend after she... It helped. Being in church.

NOTE FROM MEMORIAL RUNNING THROUGH EVAN'S HEAD: "I was head pastor at the Covenant Church where Olivia was directing a women's chorus in our practice space. She was a lovely woman to work with and full of spirit. Full of life. I regret not approaching her and spreading the love of Jesus to her. I feel like I have been a
